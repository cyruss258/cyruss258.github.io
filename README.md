# About Me
Hello! My name is Sina Cyrus and I am a Data Analyst. With a strong engineering background, I possess a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics, and a meticulous attention to detail. Throughout my career, I have excelled in leading cross-functional projects, driving efficiency, and fostering growth. I take pride in my unique blend of intelligence and dedication to hard work. Transitioning into the field of data analytics, I have thrived as an analyst, influencing decision-making at various leadership levels through my technical and non-technical expertise.

Having worked in the paint industry across multiple countries, from Iran to Canada and now the UK, I have developed a deep passion for working with numbers and extracting valuable insights from data. This passion drove me to pursue professional development in the UK and kick-started my career as a data analyst.
